# Registration Form with QR Code Generation

This project is a registration form that stores user data locally and generates a QR code corresponding to the row number where the user’s information is stored. After registration, the QR code can be scanned to retrieve and display user information.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Stores user data (name, email, etc.).
- **QR Code Generation**: Generates a unique QR code based on the user's data row in the database.
- **Data Retrieval**: Users can scan their QR code to view their stored information.
- **Edit and Print**: Users can edit their information and print the QR code and user ID.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js (or local storage, depending on the implementation)
- **QR Code Generation**: QR Code generation library (e.g., `qrcode.js`)
